# Introduction
One month ago, I participated in my first-ever Hackathon organized by SegmentFault and Google. The theme was [Innovate for the Future](https://pages.segmentfault.com/google-hackathon-2024-2) and the competition spanned a considerable amount of time, allowing for deep exploration and development.

# Preparation
At first, I had no idea how to find teammates for the Hackathon. After signing up, I didn’t give it much thought and just went about my usual routine. Then, one day, out of the blue, someone in the group chat mentioned they were looking for a frontend developer. Without hesitation, I volunteered and eagerly showcased my skills and strengths. I highlighted my enthusiasm and willingness to learn, even though I was still a student. Fortunately, the person appreciated my eagerness to learn and decided to let me join their team.

The first task he assigned to me was to refactor a website I had previously built, but this time using Next.js. This was a significant step up for me, as I had some experience with web development but hadn’t yet worked with those frontend frameworks like React. The challenge was both exciting and daunting, as it required me to quickly learn and adapt to a new framework.

# Our Journey Begin!
“Do you know Miss Minutes from Loki? She’s such an adorable character! Why not turn her into an AI assistant?”

And with that thought, our journey began.

# Harsh Reality
In the end, we didn’t make it very far. Our idea didn’t even pass the initial review stage. It was a bit disappointing, but also kind of funny looking back—considering how much effort we put in. Despite the setback, it was a valuable experience that taught me a lot about teamwork, creativity, and the importance of being open to learning new things.
