<BaseLayout pageTitle={'About Me'}>
	<h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>

	<p>I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second page on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!</p>

	<p>This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking back and see how my journey is going!</p>

	<p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
		<li>I live in {identity.country} and I work as a {identity.occupation}.</li>
		{identity.hobbies.length >= 2 &&
			<li>My hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]}, {identity.hobbies[1]}  and {identity.hobbies[2]}.</li>
		}
	</ul>
	<p>My skills are:</p>
	<ul>
		{skills.map((skill) => <li>{skill}</li>)}
	</ul>
